## Introducing Arrow

* larger than memory data
* Acero
* datasets
* R bindings to dplyr and tidyverse functions
  * lubridate
  * stringr
  * request any which aren't implemented that you'd like!
  
## Arrow

* larger-than-memory != big data (necessarily)


::: {.notes}
* when demonstrating Arrow we often use New York taxis dataset (describe)
* then show a dplyr pipeline and some sort of timed comparison running with in dplyr and loading it all into memory versus with Arrow
:::

## Why Arrow on Pi?

* can analyse all your data, not just what can fit in memory
* local monitoring can have longer history
* analyse logs with Datasets API

## Why Arrow and Shiny

* talk about case studies

## Let's see this in action

::: {.notes}
* show the local monitoring Shiny app
* show simulations of analyses on 1Gb RAM machines??
* show the S3 functionality of the global Shiny app (normally you'd have to pull all of it into your app or manage it in a DB)
